# Fullstack Job Board Platform

This is a job board platform with role-based access control, file uploads, and a company dashboard.

## ✅ What's Working?
- **Role-Based Access Control** (Admin, Company, Job Seeker)
- **Resume Uploads** using `multer`
- **Minimal Company Dashboard** to manage job postings
- **WebSockets** for real-time job updates
- **Optimized Database Queries** using Prisma with MongoDB

## ❌ What's Missing?
- **Complete UI Styling:** The frontend works but lacks proper styling.
- **Authentication UI:** Login & Signup forms are basic.
- **Job Application Feature:** Job Seekers cannot yet apply via UI.
- **Deployment:** The project is not yet deployed.

## ⏳ How Would I Complete It with More Time?
- Add a **fully styled UI** with better job search & filters.
- Implement **job application tracking** with status updates.
- Deploy on **Vercel (Frontend) & Render (Backend)** for public access.
- Improve **performance optimizations** for API calls.
